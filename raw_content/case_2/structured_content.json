Since January this year **,** SafetyCulture has been working with Relevance AI to onboard their first AI Agent: an AI teammate who can answer customer questions and book meetings on autopilot.\n\n\u200d\n\nSafetyCulture Recruits Bosh by Relevance AI\n\n![](https://site.relevanceai.com/customers/%3CBase64-Image-Removed%3E)\n\nClick for sound\n\n3:57\n\n\u200d\n\n**The Challenge: Capturing Demand**\n\nSafetyCulture had a problem that was hindering their growth; there was too much demand for their services, with a high variability of intent, and they didn\u2019t have the capacity to meet it. Typically, booking meetings with prospects would require:\n\n- Sifting through the backlog of inbound enquiries.\n- Researching companies one by one to ensure they are a good fit.\n- Personalizing messaging.\n- Answering any questions.\n- Scheduling a meeting.\n\nAs Mike Welch, Managing Director of SafetyCulture Training, says:\n\n> It\u2019s just a volume problem. The way we\u2019ve built our product-led growth engines at SafetyCulture means we are getting a lot of leads. Our team was sitting down and spending countless hours and days building personalized custom outreach to make sure that we hooked customers and that they understand the value that we can provide. That takes a lot of time, and it means we can\u2019t reach out to everyone we\u2019d like to.\n\n## \u200d  The Solution: SafetyCulture recruits Bosh, the AI Agent, by Relevance AI\n\nWith Relevance AI, companies can \u2018employ\u2019 AI teammates like they would hire an employee. AI Employees are onboarded like a new hire and trained to work in the way your company wants them to, akin to roles and responsibilities of a typical employment contract. These employees self-improve based on feedback over time.\n\nThere is no \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 with Relevance AI agents. When an AI agent is recruited by a business it is completely customized to meet their unique requirements and processes.\n\nSafetyCultures AI Agent was trained on their:\n\n- Ideal customer profile\n- Use cases and value propositions\n- Messaging guidelines\n- Objection handling\n- Frequently asked questions\n- Tech stack, including their CRM\n- Handover process to (human) colleagues\n\n\u200d\n\n> The thing that differentiated Relevance AI was this felt like a person working in the business with us. It\u2019s learning, it\u2019s growing, it\u2019s training itself. It\u2019s almost like we have another person doing this sitting next to us.\n\n![mike welsh](https://site.relevanceai.com/customers/%3CBase64-Image-Removed%3E)\nMike Welch\n\nManaging Director\n\n\n\n## The Results: Growing customers on autopilot\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\n- 3x the number of meetings, at 50% of the cost per meeting. _\u200d_\n- 2x the number of qualified opportunities passed to Sales.\n- No leads allowed to go cold, since Bosh worked 24/7 to engage them.\n- A happier team that can focus on more high value tasks and are no longer bogged down with admin.\n\n\u200d\n\n> We had this account executive who went on holiday for a week when we were going live with Bosh. When they got back, they expected to have to do a bunch of admin work and calendar admin. Instead, they had more than 30 meetings booked. Their entire week was full of nothing but demos!\n\n![mike welsh](https://site.relevanceai.com/customers/%3CBase64-Image-Removed%3E)\nMike Welch\n\nManaging Director\n\n\n## \u200d  \u200dWhat\u2019s Next: Building their AI Workforce\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/637e7afd450ee24fb878e5b0/66a877fcaabd572bfb8eb329_667e984de5ffbb87e31f0ddd_safetyculture-hero%2520(1).png)\n\n\u200d\n\n**\u200d** SafetyCulture has empowered their inbound customer team to focus on delivering demos and building relationships, now that they no longer need to do the admin slog of book meetings.\n\nAs Mike Welch says, \"We\u2019ve got our first agent up and running and the return on that has been so fast and so steep. So now we are literally looking at how do we pour gasoline on this thing? How can we enable our team to focus on what they do best, building relationships and being that trusted advisor.\"\n\nThe reaction internally has been huge. SafetyCulture are now actively looking at many other tasks across their entire business that can be handed off to an AI teammate.\n\n\u200d\n\n> Yeah, so I mean, we\u2019ve done this in a microcosm, but we can apply this to marketing, to support, to in house operations, and to finance. There are so many areas where we waste all this time and effort to do basic admin work, connecting dots, et cetera. So, we\u2019re really rethinking the entire thing.\n\n![mike welsh](https://site.relevanceai.com/customers/%3CBase64-Image-Removed%3E)\nMike Welch\n\nManaging Director\n\n\n### Recruit Bosh, the AI BDR\n\nGrow your business, not your headcount\n\n[Request demo](https://site.relevanceai.com/bosh-sales-agent)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636cad09a1159553a45e8ba1/65e657e1a2548c84515c8607_ideal-stars-bg.svg)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636cad09a1159553a45e8ba1/65dc1797ba41bda71533bd2f_prism-guy.svg)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636cad09a1159553a45e8ba1/65dc15f8fc23075e4991ae5c_world-guy.svg)\n\n## Build your AI workforce today!\n\nRecruit AI teammates and complete tasks on autopilot.\n\nGrow your business, not your headcount.\n\n[Try for free](https://auth.relevanceai.com/signup/) [Request demo](https://site.relevanceai.com/book-a-demo)\n\nFree plan\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636cad09a1159553a45e8ba1/65dbf38bdf4c613e7628342e_star-icon.svg)\n\nNo card required",
